    <label><strong>Introduction to Angular</strong></label>
  </div>
  <div>
    <label><strong>Description:</strong></label>
    Angular, developed and maintained by Google, is a powerful open-source framework for building dynamic web applications. Known for its flexibility and scalability, Angular has gained popularity
    among developers for creating modern, feature-rich, and maintainable applications.
  </div>
  <div>
    <label><strong>Overview:</strong></label>
    Angular is a front-end framework that utilizes TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, to enhance the development experience. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern,
    providing a structured and organized approach to building web applications. With a rich set of tools and libraries, Angular simplifies common development tasks, allowing developers to focus on
    creating robust applications.
  </div>
  <div>
    <label><strong>Getting Started:</strong></label>
    To start working with Angular, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Angular applications are built and managed using the Angular CLI (Command Line
    Interface). Once the prerequisites are in place, you can create a new Angular project with a single command, setting you up for efficient development.
  </div>
  <div>
    <label><strong>Main Part and Features:</strong></label>
    The core strength of Angular lies in its declarative templates, dependency injection, end-to-end tooling, and integrated best practices. Declarative templates enable developers to express the
    structure of the application effortlessly. Angular's dependency injection system promotes modular and maintainable code by efficiently managing component dependencies.

    Angular's two-way data binding ensures seamless communication between the model and the view, providing a real-time interactive experience for users. The framework also facilitates the creation of
    dynamic single-page applications (SPAs), where content is loaded dynamically as the user navigates through the app, resulting in a smooth and responsive user interface.
  </div>
  <div>
    <label><strong>Self-razz:</strong></label>
    Angular's extensive library of pre-built components and the ability to create custom components empower developers to design complex UIs with ease. The framework's robust testing capabilities and
    integration with popular testing tools contribute to building reliable and bug-free applications.
  </div>
  <div>
    <label><strong>In conclusion:</strong></label>
    Angular is a comprehensive framework that streamlines the development of modern web applications. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, Angular's rich features and robust
    architecture make it a go-to choice for building scalable and efficient applications.
